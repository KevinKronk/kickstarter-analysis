# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

We are analyzing kickstarter data to uncover the trends of successful campaigns in order to help Louise make better decisions about her own campaigns. Louise is primarily concerned with theater, particularly plays. She wants to better understand how the launch date and funding goals affected the outcomes of the kickstarters, and use that information to determine dates and goals to shoot for.
